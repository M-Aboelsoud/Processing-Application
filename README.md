The application invokes image processing and manipulation. The user will be able to apply visual effects on the image using convultion filters, draw shapes and further manipulation. Currently, the program is under development with the following features:

- Load an image
- Save an image
- Apply a blur filter 
- Apply a find egdes filter
- Apply a sharpen filter
- Change image brightness using RGB-HSB conversion
- Clear the panel
- Undo any effects applied on the images

Future features will be the following: 

- Scale image
- Change image hue value
- Change image saturation value
- Draw different types of shapes
- Move the shapes
- Re-size the shapes
- Color the shapes
- Use a custom colorpicker to color the shapes as per the user's wish
